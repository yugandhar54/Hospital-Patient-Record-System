# Hospital-Patient-Record-System
A Command Line Interface (CLI) based application built in C++ to efficiently manage hospital patient records. This project demonstrates the practical use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) concepts to handle real-world data management tasks.

🚀 Features
Add New Patient Records – Store essential patient information in an organized manner
Update Existing Records – Modify details instantly with efficient search operations
Delete Patient Records – Remove outdated or invalid entries
Search Patient Data – Quickly find patient information using optimized lookup
DSA Implementation
Linked Lists for dynamic record management
Stacks & Queues for maintaining history, logs, or process flows
Memory-Efficient Architecture – Designed with proper memory handling and optimized data operations
Modular Code Structure – Clean, readable, and scalable for further enhancements

🧱 Tech Stack
C++
Object-Oriented Programming
Data Structures & Algorithms

🎯 Highlights
This project showcases how fundamental DSA concepts can be applied to build a fully functional record management system. It is ideal for learning purposes and can be extended into a complete hospital management system with features like billing, doctor scheduling, and report generation.
